# WOM.fm-Sandbox

This is a sandbox repository for [WOM.fm](https://wom.fm). It can serve as a starting point for the development of an audio web application that can be used by local organizations to make vital knowledge and practical information accessible to marginalized, often illiterate populations.

You can check out the final app [here](https://oseqorg.github.io/WOM.fm-Sandbox/)
